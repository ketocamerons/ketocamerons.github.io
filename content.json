Ingredients 2 x 400ml (13.7oz) cans full fat coconut cream or coconut milk *See Notes 2 tablespoons confectioners sweetener 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder pinch of salt (optional) 20 g | 2 squares 70% chocolate , shaved (optional for extra richness – or sugar free chocolate chips) extra shaved chocolate to garnish Instructions Place sealed cans of coconut cream (or milk) in the refrigerator overnight. Without shaking the cans, open and scoop out the thick cream sitting at the top over the water. Transfer the cream to a bowl and discard the liquid left in the cans. Add the sweetener (or sugar) and beat on high using a hand mixer (or whisk) until thick and creamy (about 1-2 minutes). Reserve about 4 tablespoons of the plain ‘whipped cream’ to use as a topping to serve with (optional), and set aside. Fold the cocoa powder and salt through the cream and beat (or whisk) again until smooth, well combined and thick. Fold through the shaved chocolate. Depending on the coconut milk you use, a mousse will form almost immediately once the cocoa powder is mixed through. If not, refrigerate until set and ready to serve, or serve immediately. Dollop the ‘plain whipped cream’ over the mousse and sprinkle with shaved chocolate (if using). Notes*I found coconut cream worked the best, but you can use coconut milk. Do not try to use light or reduced fat. You need the fat content in both the cream and/or milk to make the cream successfully or it may not work.","categories":[{"name":"Desserts","slug":"Desserts","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Desserts/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Chocolate","slug":"Chocolate","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Chocolate/"},{"name":"Cocoa","slug":"Cocoa","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Cocoa/"},{"name":"Coconut","slug":"Coconut","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Coconut/"},{"name":"Dairy Free","slug":"Dairy-Free","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Dairy-Free/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"Desserts","slug":"Desserts","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Desserts/"}]},{"title":"New York-Style Cheesecake","slug":"New-York-Style-Cheesecake","date":"2017-12-30T07:08:11.000Z","updated":"2018-04-02T05:54:14.915Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/12/30/New-York-Style-Cheesecake/","link":"","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/2017/12/30/New-York-Style-Cheesecake/","excerpt":"Another Christmas hit that I would definitely recommend trying for yourself.

Set aside in a bowl. Heat a skillet to medium heat and add the butter. As the butter melts dice the onion and garlic and add it to the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the onions are translucent and fragrant. Increase the pan heat to medium-high and add the chicken. Cook it almost entirely through - the outside should be white and this will take about 3-5 minutes. Once the chicken looks almost fully cooked add in the heavy whipping cream and tomato paste. Using a spatula mix in the tomato paste so it runs smooth through the heavy whipping cream. It should be an orange color at this point. Turn the heat to medium-low and cover with a lid for 5-7 minutes. Remove lid and combine. The chicken is fully cooked and you should be able to eat it. However, if you like a thicker curry sauce allow it to reduce with the lid off until it reaches the consistency you like. Serve with low carb naan or over cauliflower rice. Enjoy! NoteYou can store the butter chicken in a sealed container for up to 10 days in the fridge and 2 months in the freezer. You can also use chicken thighs instead of breast for a higher fat content.","categories":[{"name":"Meals","slug":"Meals","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Meals/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Butter","slug":"Butter","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Butter/"},{"name":"Cinnamon","slug":"Cinnamon","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Cinnamon/"},{"name":"Chicken","slug":"Chicken","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Chicken/"},{"name":"Cream","slug":"Cream","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Cream/"},{"name":"Tomato Paste","slug":"Tomato-Paste","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Tomato-Paste/"},{"name":"Garlic","slug":"Garlic","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Garlic/"},{"name":"Turmeric","slug":"Turmeric","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Turmeric/"},{"name":"Ginger","slug":"Ginger","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Ginger/"},{"name":"Chilli","slug":"Chilli","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Chilli/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"Meals","slug":"Meals","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Meals/"}]},{"title":"Breakfast Cookies","slug":"Breakfast-Cookies","date":"2017-12-13T21:32:48.000Z","updated":"2018-04-02T05:54:14.915Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/12/14/Breakfast-Cookies/","link":"","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/2017/12/14/Breakfast-Cookies/","excerpt":"This is a recipe I can really vouch for to beat sugar cravings.

Prep time: 20 minsCook time: 50 minsTotal time: 1 hour 10 minsMakes: 24 pieces Ingredients 1 cup coconut flour 1/2 tsp baking soda 1/2 tsp salt 2/3 cup coconut oil 2 12-oz bags of sugar-free choc chips/chocolate, divided 3/4 cup sugar-free maple syrup (or sweetener to taste) 2 tsp vanilla extract 5 eggs, at room temperature Instructions Preheat oven to 325 F (160 C). Mix dry ingredients in a medium size bowl and set aside. Melt 1 bag of chocolate chips/chocolate in a small saucepan over low heat. Once the chocolate is completely melted you’ll need to add the coconut oil, maple syrup and vanilla extract to the chocolate. Mix well and turn off the heat. Pour the melted chocolate into the batter. Mix ingredients together. Add the eggs to the batter and mix thoroughly. It’s important that the eggs are at room temperature so they don’t cause the coconut oil to harden in the batter. The brownies will cook uneven if this happens. Grease a 9x13 inch pan with coconut oil, ghee or butter. Pour half of the brownie batter into the pan. Sprinkle to top of the batter with 6 ounces of chocolate chips (half a bag).Pour the remainder of the batter over the chocolate chip layer. Sprinkle the second half of the bag of chocolate chips over the top brownie layer. Bake the brownies for 50 - 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the pan comes out clean. Let the brownies cool before slicing and serving.","categories":[{"name":"Desserts","slug":"Desserts","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Desserts/"},{"name":"Snacks","slug":"Snacks","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Snacks/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Egg","slug":"Egg","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Egg/"},{"name":"Chocolate","slug":"Chocolate","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Chocolate/"},{"name":"Coconut Flour","slug":"Coconut-Flour","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Coconut-Flour/"},{"name":"Dairy Free","slug":"Dairy-Free","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Dairy-Free/"},{"name":"Coconut Oil","slug":"Coconut-Oil","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Coconut-Oil/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"Desserts","slug":"Desserts","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Desserts/"},{"name":"Snacks","slug":"Snacks","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Snacks/"}]},{"title":"Shortbread Cookies","slug":"Shortbread-Cookies","date":"2017-12-13T21:01:29.000Z","updated":"2018-04-02T05:54:14.915Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/12/14/Shortbread-Cookies/","link":"","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/2017/12/14/Shortbread-Cookies/","excerpt":"Another one that I haven’t tried yet, but am very excited to for Christmas!

Prep Time 15 minutes Cook Time 12 minutes Total Time 27 minutes Servings 40 cookies Calories 52 kcal IngredientsShortbread 1/2 cup unsalted butter (COLD) 120g/4.23oz* 1 cup blanched almond flour 140g/5.25oz 1/2 cup oat fiber 60g/2.11oz** 1/2 tsp sea salt 6 tbsp powdered erythritol 60g/2.11oz* 1/4 tsp stevia powder Chocolate Dip 6 tbsp lilys chocolate chips 84g/2.96oz 1 tbsp coconut oil InstructionsBefore making this recipe, make sure to MEASURE all of the ingredients. It WILL affect the cookie dough if it’s not the exact measurements. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F. In a stand mixer with the dough hook attached, add the cold butter, almond flour, oat fiber, erythritol, stevia and sea salt. Start the stand mixer (or food processor/strong hand mixer) on the lowest setting and mix for a couple of minutes until it forms a dough. With your hands, grab the dough and form a ball. Place the ball on top of a parchment paper, place another piece of parchment paper over the ball and press down. With a rolling pin, roll into a 0.3-0.4 inch/0.8-1cm thick disk. Cut into small bricks or cut using biscuit cutters, a knife or a pizza cutter. You should be able to make 40 cookies. With a dough scraper, lift up each cookie and place onto the baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 12-15 minutes until golden brown. Take out of the oven and let cool completely. This will solidify the cookies. Once the cookies are cooled, you can dip them in chocolate. In a small bowl, add the chocolate chips and coconut oil and microwave 40ish seconds until melted. Stir with a spatula to make sure all of the chocolate has melted properly. Dip each cookie into the chocolate halfway (or whatever design you want) and place each dipped cookie back onto the parchment paper. If it’s winter you can leave the cookies onto the counter as the chocolate shouldn’t melt, but in summer, store the cookies into the fridge as the chocolate will melt off. NotesYou can use palm shortening for a dairy-free version.For paleo, switch the oat fiber to arrowroot or tapioca flour. For paleo, switch the erythritol to a sweetener of your choice.","categories":[{"name":"Biscuits/Cookies","slug":"Biscuits-Cookies","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Biscuits-Cookies/"},{"name":"Snacks","slug":"Snacks","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Snacks/"},{"name":"Christmas Recipes","slug":"Christmas-Recipes","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Christmas-Recipes/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Almond Flour","slug":"Almond-Flour","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Almond-Flour/"},{"name":"Butter","slug":"Butter","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Butter/"},{"name":"Chocolate","slug":"Chocolate","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Chocolate/"},{"name":"Coconut Oil","slug":"Coconut-Oil","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Coconut-Oil/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"Biscuits/Cookies","slug":"Biscuits-Cookies","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Biscuits-Cookies/"},{"name":"Snacks","slug":"Snacks","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Snacks/"},{"name":"Christmas Recipes","slug":"Christmas-Recipes","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Christmas-Recipes/"}]},{"title":"Mini Cheese Loaves","slug":"Mini-Cheese-Loaves","date":"2017-12-13T20:55:49.000Z","updated":"2018-04-02T05:54:14.915Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/12/14/Mini-Cheese-Loaves/","link":"","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/2017/12/14/Mini-Cheese-Loaves/","excerpt":"These little cheese loaves make a great snack, warm or cold.

I leave mine in the freezer, because they melt very easily. The recipe can be found here. IngredientsChocolate / Carob Base: 1/2 cup coconut oil (palm shortening would work well too, as well as butter) 1/2 cup almond butter (any nut or seed butter would work, but almond is especially nice) 1/4 cup granulated sweetener or appropriate substitute (for candida diets, xylitol and erythritol work well. 4-6 scoops stevia extract is a good alternative) 6 Tbsp cocoa (for more health benefits, use raw cacao, or use carob for AIP) 3 Tbsp additional sweetetner (I use vegetable glycerine, xylitol, erythritol, or any combination thereof, due to being on a candida diet, which I started a number of years ago. Use a little more if using erythritol since it isn’t as sweet. You could use my DIY Truvia or 1½ scoops stevia as well) 1 tsp vanilla Coconut Topping: 1 2/3 cup unsweetened coconut flakes 7 Tbsp coconut oil (palm shortening or butter would work well too) 1/3 cup granulated sweetener 1 1/2 tsp vanilla 1/4 tsp additional flavoring (optional. Almond or coconut are good choices) 2 tsp arrowroot powder (non-gmo cornstarch may be substituted. Use 1/16 tsp of xanthan gum or glucomannan if you need to avoid these foods.) Almond halves or slices (optional) InstructionsBase: Melt oil and nut / seed butter over low heat. Stir in cocoa/carob (sifted if you like, but I have never bothered with this) and granulated sweetener and combine thoroughly. Mix in remaining ingredients except for vanilla. Continuously stir until it slightly thickens, then remove from heat. Stir in the vanilla. Pour the mixture into an 8×8 pan and place in freezer to harden while you make the topping. If you don’t have room in your freezer, the fridge will get it solid enough to work with. Topping: Melt oil in small pan and add coconut flakes. Stir. Add remaining ingredients. Simmer and stir until it thickens a bit. Once the chocolate is hardened, gently smooth the coconut mixture on top. Place slivered or whole almonds on top. Place bars back in the freezer until hardened. Again, the fridge will work, but it will take longer. Slice into squares of desired size and enjoy! They’ll probably be too hard to cut right out of the freezer so you may need to let them thaw a bit first. Store in the refrigerator","categories":[{"name":"Desserts","slug":"Desserts","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Desserts/"},{"name":"Snacks","slug":"Snacks","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Snacks/"},{"name":"Fat Bombs","slug":"Fat-Bombs","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Fat-Bombs/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Chocolate","slug":"Chocolate","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Chocolate/"},{"name":"Almond","slug":"Almond","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Almond/"},{"name":"Coconut","slug":"Coconut","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Coconut/"},{"name":"Dairy Free","slug":"Dairy-Free","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/tags/Dairy-Free/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"Desserts","slug":"Desserts","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Desserts/"},{"name":"Snacks","slug":"Snacks","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Snacks/"},{"name":"Fat Bombs","slug":"Fat-Bombs","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/categories/Fat-Bombs/"}]},{"title":"Test Post","slug":"stuff/Em-Is-Cool","date":"2017-12-12T10:15:54.000Z","updated":"2018-04-02T05:54:14.918Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/12/12/stuff/Em-Is-Cool/","link":"","permalink":"http://ketocamerons.github.io/2017/12/12/stuff/Em-Is-Cool/","excerpt":"Test post","text":"Test post h1 Heading 8-)h2 Headingh3 Headingh4 Headingh5 Headingh6 HeadingHorizontal Rules Typographic replacementsEnable typographer option to see result.
